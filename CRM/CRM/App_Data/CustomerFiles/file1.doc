 What's wrong? 	 Nothing. Anna leans down and picks up her RED SLIP from the floor. 	

 Is this about us? 	 her head bowed as she lets the water wash over her. 	

 Then what is it? 	 I don't know. 	

 Mrs. Ayres? 	 I'm sorry. Yes. A private visitation. 	

 Mr. Deane? What happens when we die? 	
 Jack? 	 Nothing Miss Bryant. 	

 You ordering in another pizza? 	 Yeah. With wheatgrass and alfalfa sprouts. Everyone laughs. 	

 We still on for tonight? 	 Anna? 	

 Anna? 	 I don't know Paul. 	

 Promise? 	 I promise. 	

 Is someone there? 	
 Shouldn't you be home? 	 My mom's picking me up. 	

 Where are you going? 	 I have to go to a funeral. My old piano teacher. 	

 (with sudden interest) Can I come? 	 No Jack. Funerals are very private affairs. 	

 It wouldn't be appropriate Jack. Anyway wouldn't your mom worry about you? 	 Not really. 	

 Anna? Is that you? 	 Yes Mother. 	

 Can I get you something to eat? 	 I'm not hungry. 	

 You've forgotten haven't you? 	 No I haven't forgotten. The service isn't till six. 	

 Where are you going? 	 To do the washing up. 	

 You weren't here Monday. You never sleep at home anymore. What if something happened to me in the middle of the night? 	 Nothing is going to happen to you. 	

 White roses. They were his favorite. How did you know? 	 They just seemed appropriate somehow. 	

 How's your mother? 	 Fine. She sends her condolences. 	

 Are you ready to order? 	 Yes. We'll have the duck. 	

 Let's not argue tonight. OK? 	 Anna takes a sip of wine. 	

 I'm not being ridiculous. Why do you always talk to me like I'm a small child? 	 (as if talking to a small child) Anna. 	

 See? There you go again. Do you know how irritating that is? 	 Jesus. Can't we just have one fucking meal without arguing-- 	

 Don't touch me! Why are you touching me? 	 I'm preparing your body. You have to look beautiful for your funeral. 	

 What shall I do with this? 	 Where's the other one? The Assistant looks round. He can't see the other shoe anywhere. He turns to the Old Guy and shrugs. 	

 It's me again. I must have just missed you at home. Call me when you get this. OK? 	
 Did she call in sick? 	 She hasn't called in at all. It's not like her. She always calls in. Paul's worried now. Something's wrong. 	

 What are you doing? 	 This will relax your muscles. Stop the rigor mortis setting in so I can work on your body. He INJECTS Anna in the neck. Just then we hear a car pull up on the gravel driveway outside. 	

 What's the point of preserving the body if the soul's already left? 	 (quietly to himself) No. The soul never leaves. Beatrice stares at Anna. 	

 Yes? 	 Her hair. She was a brunette. I'd like it back to that color. 	

 What's wrong? 	 I think you better come in. 	

 What happened? Where's Anna? 	 Anna was in a car accident last night. My daughter's dead. That's what happened. Paul stares at Beatrice's back in disbelief. 	

 Why didn't you call me? 	 You took her away from me. I don't want you anywhere near her. 	

 Mr. Deane? 	 Yes. 	

 Who was that? 	 No one. 	

 You weren't going to tell me Paul was here, were you? 	 No. 	

 Why not? 	
 Oh I nearly forgot. How tall are you? 	 What!? He looks her up and down. Gauging her height. 	

 Why..? 	 I need to know how tall you are. For your coffin. Anna's stunned. Eliot looks at her for a moment. Then switches off the main lights. 	

 Is Tom in? 	 The captain just stepped out. He won't be long. You can wait in his office if you want. 	

 You OK? 	 I'm fine. 	

 What do you mean? 	 The funeral director won't let me see her Tom. He says I'm not family. Can you talk to him? Put some pressure on him. 	

 You sure you're OK? 	 I fucked up. 	

 Who is she? 	 Mrs. Whitehall. He mixes the dye in a bowl as he moves over to Anna. 	

 Why? 	 To help them make the transition. Anna's stunned. For the first time we sense a seed of doubt in her mind. 	

 Is this what happens when you die? 	 It depends on how you lived your life. 	

 What do you mean? 	 Not everyone needs my help. Some let go as soon as their body dies. Others don't let go until long after they're in the grave. 	

 Am I a ghost? Is that why I'm here? 	 You're here so I can bury you. Anna's silent. Trying to make sense of what she's just heard. Eliot takes her arm. Leads her to the slab. 	

 Are you cold? 	
 Who are you? 	
 Did you know Mrs. Whitehall? 	 I thought it was Miss Bryant's funeral. 	

 Why? 	 Why? Because she's not ready. 	

 Is the flower for her? 	 She was my teacher. 	

 And you are? 	 Jack. Jack holds out his hand. A serious look on his face. Eliot's amused. He shakes Jack's hand. 	

 Well Jack. What did you think? 	 About what? 	

 About what? 	 Mrs. Whitehall's funeral. Did you find it interesting? 	

 Mrs. Whitehall's funeral. Did you find it interesting? 	 It was OK I guess. 	

 Are all funerals the same? 	 No Jack. They're never the same. Each one is special. The dead always speak to us in different ways. 	

 What's that? 	 It's your dress. For your funeral. Your mother brought it round this morning. As Eliot takes out a pair of shiny black shoes from a plastic bag, Anna moves haltingly over to the dress. She touches the material puzzled. 	

 Why are you still struggling? 	 I'm not ready to die. Not yet. She glances at the open door again. Eliot follows her look. 	

 What do you mean? 	 (nods to the phone) He still feels your presence. You're only causing him more pain. If you really loved him, you'd accept your death and let him go. 	

 Why do I look like a corpse? 	 Because you are a corpse. 	

 Bad dream? 	 I was dead. I had a car accident. Did you ever dream you were dead? Paul doesn't reply. She turns... the bed's empty. 	

 Paul? 	 Yes? Anna looks up. Paul's in the doorway. She gets up. Suddenly the light goes off. 	

 What are you doing? 	 (puts his finger to his lips) Ssh. Don't talk so loud. You'll wake the neighbors. 	

 Aren't you going to pick it up? 	 Me? No. It's probably for Eliot. Anna's eyes snap open in shock... 	

 Is it always like this? 	 What do you mean? 	

 What do you mean? 	 I thought when you died you wouldn't feel anything. You wouldn't feel any more pain. You wouldn't have to struggle anymore. 	

 Mr. Conran? 	 Yes? 	

 Yes? 	 My name's Jack. Miss Bryant was my teacher. 	

 Am I? 	 They're not pressing charges. 	

 You didn't believe him did you? 	 No. Of course not. Tom's relieved. Paul turns back to the monitors. The ghostly figure of a YOUNG FEMALE TEACHER drifts hypnotically across the screen. 	

 What? 	 Nothing. Forget it. 	

 Does he have family? 	 Yes. A brother. He's coming in later. Anna touches the white sheet covering Frank's body. 	

 My mother... She didn't cry did she? When she came to see me? 	 (shakes his head) I'm sorry. 	

 And Paul? 	 It's not important anymore. 	

 Can I ask you something? 	 Yes. Of course. 	

 How can I help you Officer? 	 I'd like to see the body. 	

 You argue with me. As if it were my fault you're dead. As if I was to blame. (slams down the lipstick.) What? You're not talking to me now? You don't want to? 	 The crudely drawn bright red lips. Clown-like circles of rouge. Gaudy and macabre. 	

 What's it like? Are you afraid? 	 Jack. 	

 You spoke to Miss Bryant? 	 Yes. 	

 You've spoken to others? 	 Yes. Many others. 	

 Are they your favorite flower? 	 Tulips? Yes. I think so. Eliot raises Anna's arm. Delicately washes her armpit. Along the length of her arm. Her skin pale. 	

 I thought it'd be lilies. White lilies. Don't they symbolize death? 	 No. They symbolize purity. He moves to her breasts, following the contours of her body. Pausing every now and then to rinse the sponge. 	

 What's your favorite flower? 	
 What do they symbolize? 	 Faithfulness. 	

 She's not dead is she? 	 Mr. Conran. 	

 I'm sorry? 	 One of Anna's students. (nods towards the funeral home) In the window. 	

 You know him? 	 Of course I know him. He's often round here. He seems to have a strange fascination with death. He's eleven years old Mr. Conran. And like all young boys has a vivid imagination. Now if you'll excuse me-- 	

 What's down there? 	
 Just what the hell do you think you're doing? I got a call from Eliot Deane. Are you out of your fucking mind? 	 Anna's not dead Tom. He won't let me see her. He's keeping her there-- 	

 On what grounds Paul? Do you have any evidence? 	 No. But-- 	

 Called you? 	 On the telephone. Jeff snickers. Paul's beginning to realize how absurd this all sounds. 	

 Why do I have to get dressed? 	 Tomorrow's your funeral. Eliot lifts Anna's arms and puts them through the sleeves of the dress. Her body's stiff and unyielding. 	

 Already? 	 I told you. You only had three days. He delicately turns her onto her side. Buttons up the dress. 	

 Then why didn't you do anything about it? 	 No matter what I did everything just stayed the same. I'd wake up. I'd shower. Sit in the same traffic everyday on my way to work. Go home. Go to sleep. Then wake again. Eliot stops clipping her nails. Irritated. 	

 What did you really want from life? 	 I just wanted to be happy. 	

 Happy? You all say you wanted to be happy. What does it mean Anna? To be happy? 	 I don't know. Don't you understand? That's the whole point. I don't know. 	

 What did you want from life? 	
 Did you? 	 He was the only one I ever loved. But I never told him that. And then he stopped loving me. Eliot stares at her intently. Comes to a decision. 	

 Is this the end? 	 The last part is the most difficult. You'll have to face it alone. But you'll be at peace soon. Anna nods. SIGHS deeply... her BREATH FOGS the mirror. She frowns. Touches the SMALL CIRCLE OF CONDENSATION on the glass. Looks up at Eliot in shock. 	

 Violets. They were her favorite flowers. (turns to Eliot) How did you know? 	 Violets just seemed appropriate somehow. 	

 What is it? 	 She's so cold. Paul turns back to Anna. Tears prick his eyes. He touches her cheek again. Finally accepting her death. 	

 You sure you're going to be OK? 	
 Mr. Conran? 	 Don't forget to fasten your seat belt. Paul nods. Gets in his car. Jack looks up at the Funeral Home. 	

 Paul looks through the front windshield. Nothing. He frowns. Where did the ambulance go? 	 We see the Funeral Home. Bone white in the moonlight. The cemetery next to it. 	

 Paul? 	 Baby. Thank God. Paul gently helps Anna to her feet. She looks round. Dazed. Turns back to Paul. 	

 Promise? 	 Promise. Just then Paul hears a rustling sound behind him. He turns. Nothing. He cocks his head slightly. There's something unnerving about the silence. Suddenly a CROW rises noisily into the air. Paul starts. Then watches, relieved, as the crow disappears into the dark sky. He turns back to Anna... she's not there. 	

 Or do you want to make love here? 	 Where did you go? Anna puts her fingers on Paul's lips. Clearly turned on. We hear the sound of something being UNZIPPED. 	

 Scissors? What scissors? 	 Scissors. For your clothes. Eliot just put them on the table. Paul pulls back. Terrified. 	

 Where am I?
